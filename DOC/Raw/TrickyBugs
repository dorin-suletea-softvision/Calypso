1)BUG: In list DND controller line (page 120)

					//due to the delay in event handling , if deleting an entity and adding another on the place where it was
					//swing removes the entity from the sheet , but the event has it's intersectionList already initialized 
					//and resoults : deleted cmp intersects new cmp , deletedCmp getParrent==null , thus NullPointer 
					//exception
					for (int i = 0; i < intersectionList.size(); i++) {
						intersectionList.get(i).getParent().setComponentZOrder(intersectionList.get(i), i);
					}
					if (intersectionList.get(i).getParent()!=null) wont work because illegal component position is thrown after
					try catch wont work because of the future crashes in resizable border for example
